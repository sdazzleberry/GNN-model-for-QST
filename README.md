# GNN-model-for-QST
Quantum Density Matrix Reconstruction (Track 1)

This repository contains our implementation of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) designed to reconstruct a 2-qubit density matrix rho from classical shadow measurement data. Our model strictly enforces the physical constraints of being Hermitian, Positive Semi-Definite, and having a Unit Trace.Repository 

Structure:

According to the project requirements, the repository is organized as follows:

/src: Core source code for the GNN model, data generation scripts, and training loops.

/outputs: Saved model weights (.pt) and performance 

logs./docs: Detailed mathematical documentation and a step-by-step replication guide.
