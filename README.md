Quantum Density Matrix Reconstruction (Track 1)

This repository contains our implementation of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) designed to reconstruct a 2-qubit density matrix rho from classical shadow measurement data. Our model strictly enforces the physical constraints of being Hermitian, Positive Semi-Definite, and having a Unit Trace.Repository
