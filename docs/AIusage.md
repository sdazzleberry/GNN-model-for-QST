Purpose: AI (Gemini) was utilized to assist in structuring the GNN architecture and debugging the quantum measurement simulation logic.

Code Generation: Core boilerplate for the QuantumGNN class and data preprocessing scripts was refined using AI-suggested optimizations for PyTorch Geometric.

Documentation: AI helped in drafting the technical explanations for the Cholesky-like decomposition and ensuring LaTeX formatting accuracy.

Verification: All AI-generated code was manually tested, debugged for Qiskit version compatibility, and verified against quantum state reconstruction benchmarks.
